excerpt: "Imagine you are an auditorily impaired person with no sense of the sound transpiring around you. One day while walking down the road, a speeding automobile honks you to move away from the road, but you cannot hear the warnings due to your disability."

## Problem statement

The problem statement is to ensure that people who are hard of hearing can be helped in some way, by allowing them to be alerted by sounds in spite of not being able to hear. Once our basic product is made, we can expand it to include other features.

## Ideation and planning

**Flow of work:**
- Overall, we need to keep the problem statement in mind as well as the viewpoint of our target market while ideating on the product. Basically, I think that as we have a very defined problem statement, our next step is to analyse our target market and try and always keep the target market's viewpoint in mind while further ideating on the design and moving on to the prototyping stage.
- Once the market is analysed enough, we should analyse each of the ideas we came up with regarding the design and execution of the product, and see if it is feasible and matches with the needs of our target market. 

**Ideation:**
- We could probably aim to make a sort of pair of smart glasses that has really small microphones in the handles/frames of the glasses. We can provide multiple microphones in different places to capture multi-dimensional inputs.
- Besides this, for it to be effective, the screen of the glasses should be made into LCD displays to glow in specific regions when a sound is heard from a particular direction.

**Specific components:**

1. **MEMS microphone module**: 
- While creating our prototype, we can use this module to try and allow for directional sensing of sound and create an output on an LED screen depending on the direction. This initial prototype could later be integrated into the product with an appropriate design.
- We'll have to make sure we collect directional data appropriately so that it can detect which direction the appropriate frequencies are coming from and amplify those appropriately.

2. **LCD display**:
- An appropriate display will need to be used whether we are using the Google glasses smartglass model, or instead making the glasses themselves the screen. We can start off by lighting up the LCD in various places depending on the location of the sound.
